# C++ Projects Overview
This repository contains three distinct C++ projects that demonstrate a variety of key concepts in programming, including basic calculator operations, 3D point manipulation, and matrix operations. Each project is self-contained and designed to showcase different aspects of C++ programming such as classes, templates, exception handling, and mathematical operations.
## 1. Basic C++ Calculator
### Overview: 
The **Basic C++ Calculator** is a console-based program that provides users with a variety of fundamental mathematical operations. The supported operations include:
- Addision
- Subtruction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulus
- Exponentiation 
- Square
The project is designed to demonstrate the use of C++ templates, exception handling, and input validation. The main goal is to create a simple yet efficient calculator that can handle real-time mathematical computations while ensuring robust error handling.

### Key Features:
- Supports basic arithmetic operations
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Template usage for flexible operation handling

### Usage:
1. Compile and run the program.
2. Select the operation you wish to perform.
3. Enter the necessary operands.
4. The result will be displayed, or an error message will appear in case of invalid input.

## 2. 3D Point Operations
### Overview:
This project defines a **Point class** that represents points in 3-dimensional space. The class includes methods for calculating the distance from the origin, comparing distances between points, and classifying points based on their coordinates.

### Key Features:
- Calculates the Euclidean distance of a point from the origin
- Compares distances between two points
- Classifies points into regions (based on the sign of their coordinates)

### Usage:
1. Create instances of the Point class with 3D coordinates.
2. Use the available methods to compute distances or compare points.
3. Classify points based on their location in space.

## 3. Matrix Operations Library
### Overview:
The **Matrix Operations Library** is a C++ implementation that provides a set of essential matrix operations and utilities for handling matrices and vectors. The library includes a **Matrix class** encapsulated within the `MyMatrix`
namespace, allowing for matrix creation, manipulation, and transformation.

### Supported Operations:
- Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Calculation of the inverse, determinant, and trace
- Magnitude of matrices and vectors

### Key Features:
- Efficient handling of matrix operations
- Support for both basic and advanced matrix functionalities
- Ideal for applications in mathematics, engineering, and science

### Usage:
1. Include the Matrix Operations Library in your project.
2. Create matrices using the provided Matrix class.
3. Use the class methods to perform arithmetic operations, calculate determinants, or find the inverse of a matrix.
