## Project Overview

This C++ project implements a basic calculator with support for multiple operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, exponentiation, and modulus. It is designed to be simple, easy to use, and able to handle various error cases like division by zero and invalid inputs.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Square and exponentiation operations.
- Modulus operation to find the remainder.
- Input error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., text input when a number is expected).
- Reusable `Calculator` class with a templated interface (supports different numeric types like `float` and `double`).
- Simple interactive text-based menu.

## Requirements

Before using this project, ensure that you have the following:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, Visual Studio).
- Standard C++ library support.
